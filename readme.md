## 🤝 Contributing  

Found a file extension that’s missing? 🎯  

1. Create a new file named `index.YOUREXT` (replace `YOUREXT` with the extension, e.g. `index.dart`, `index.exs`).  
2. Add **around 40 lines of demo code** inside the file.  
   - Example: `index.py` →  
     ```python
     def greet(name):
         return f"Hello, {name}! 🐍"

     class Zoo:
         def __init__(self):
             self.animals = ["🦁", "🐘", "🐒", "🐼", "🦊"]

         def show(self):
             for a in self.animals:
                 print(f"Welcome {a} to the Icon Circus!")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         print(greet("Python"))
         zoo = Zoo()
         zoo.show()
     ```  
     *(Make it fun — doesn’t need to be useful, just ~40 lines showing syntax of that language/tool.)*  
3. Add it to the repo.  
4. Open a Pull Request ✅  

Let’s make this the **biggest file-extension zoo** 🦓🐘🐒 together!
